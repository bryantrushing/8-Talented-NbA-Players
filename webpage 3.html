        Wardell, Stephen Curry in full The Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA) won championships in 2014–15, 2016–17, 2017–18, and 2021–22 under the leadership of Stephen Curry II, also known as Steph, who was born on March 14, 1988 in Akron, Ohio, the United States. In 2015–16, the Warriors posted the best regular-season record in league history (73–9).

Curry, the son of 16-year NBA player and accurate shooter Dell Curry, grew up playing basketball. The elder Curry taught his son how to play the game's nuances. College coaches did not take his accurate shooting and strong "basketball IQ" into account because of his wiry build and ordinary 6-foot (1.8-metre) height. Davidson (North Carolina) College, which had an excellent basketball program, offered him a scholarship, but he declined it.his performance featured the shot that would become known as Curry's signature shot: a three-pointer from well outside the arc. While he did not perform any similar postseason miracles during his junior season, his average of 28.6 points per game topped the nation, and he was selected to the first team of the All-Americans by consensus. He subsequently participated in the 2009 NBA Draft, where the Warriors took him with the seventh overall choice.
