        Michael Jeffrey Jordan, also known as Air Jordan, was a professional and collegiate basketball player from the United States who was born in Brooklyn, New York, on February 17, 1963. He is regarded as one of the best all-around players in the history of the sport. In 1991–1993, 1996–98, he guided the Chicago Bulls to six National Basketball Association (NBA) titles.

Jordan was born and raised in Wilmington, North Carolina, and attended at UNC Chapel Hill in 1981. In the 1982 national championship game versus Georgetown, he scored the game-winning basket as a freshman. Jordan left North Carolina following his junior year and was voted College Player of the Year both in his sophomore and junior years. In 1984 in Los Angeles, he guided the American basketball team to Olympic gold medals.When he first visited a course in the summer of 1984 with a group that included future golf pro Davis Love III, Micheal Jordan developed a passion for the game. He aced one of the holes that day, which gave this incredibly self-assured athlete hope that with a little more practice, he could ace all 18 holes. In his pursuit of excellence, he squeezed as many games as he could into his free time, even turning down the president of the United States of America's invitation to the White House in 1991 along with the rest of the NBA champion Chicago Bulls. From 2001 until 2014, he continued to host the Michael Jordan Celebrity Invitational Pro-Am Golf Tournament in Las Vegas.
